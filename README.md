# carpool
A car (any vehicle) pooling web app, with very simple &amp; sleek Interface

The website is hosted at <a href="http://orapool.dx.am/">this</a> site

carpool_db.sql file contains the sql commands to be run in the DB to create the various schemas used by this app
sql_queries.txt file contains the sql commands to be run for various triggers required by the schema created above

An even more light weight version of this site is hosted <a href="http://orapool.dx.am/lightweight">here</a>. Most of the core code is being re-used, where many performance modifications have been done using jquery. The code will be uploaded to git hub in a couple of days (TODO)
